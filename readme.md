# Divvy Biketrip Analysis ![Test](https://github.com/ETM1123/Divvy-Bikeshare-Project/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview
In this repository - we are going to analyze Divvy's bike share data in the Chicago metropolitan area. Our objective is to understand the relationship between the different kind of members: Casual (users who don't have an annual subscription i.e day pass), Members (users who have annual subscription).

We are going to go through the entire data analysis process:
- ask 
- prepare
- process 
- analyze 
- share 

and automate the process. We are also going to practice good software development practices and make this repository  a testable package. The test flag above, by the name of project will indicate the most current state of the repository. In other words, we set up an automated testing environment that tests every time we make a change to the project.
